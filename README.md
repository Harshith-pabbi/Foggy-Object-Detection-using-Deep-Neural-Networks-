# Foggy Object Detection using Deep Neural Networks

This project focuses on **object detection in foggy weather conditions** using a combination of **AOD-Net for dehazing** and **YOLOv8** for detection.  
It was presented and published at the **2025 Global Conference in Emerging Technology (GINOTECH), IEEE Pune Section**.
